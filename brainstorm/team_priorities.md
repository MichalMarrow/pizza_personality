/*
As you identify your top 3 ideas, research and collaborate to define 
your MVP and other important factors:
● What is the problem you’re solving, and your solution?
    - We want to let the user have fun answering personality questions, and get quirky but fun results as a Pizza!
    - The solution is a personality quiz that works on a point-based system, 
    that will tally up points based on the user's answer
    and provides the final result at the end of the quiz

● What is the MVP scope?
    - Have a functional and pretty frontend that takes user answers, 
    tallies up points based on answers
    and returns final results based on points tallied

○ What are the core features / functionality you must get working to
define the product and make it usable?
    - Come up with personality results first objectively
    - Come up with personality questions that we can connect to different types of pizza
    - Point system that will be tying the questions and the results together

● What are the stretch goals?
    - Login functionality?
    - Share the quiz by email to someone else

● Team responsibility breakdown: who will work on what?
    - Database - Everyone
    - CSS involved - Thin Thin
    - Webpack - Daniel
    - React/Express - Michal
