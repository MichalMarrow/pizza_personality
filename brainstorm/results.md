The Classics (Reliable, Chill, Low-Drama)
These people are comforting, consistent, and secretly everyoneâ€™s favorite.

Plain Cheese â€“ The minimalist. Quiet confidence, always dependable.

All Pepperoni â€“ Straightforward and bold. Doesnâ€™t overthink it, gets things done.

Margherita â€“ Elegant and artsy. Values aesthetics and chill vibes.

White â€“ Low-key intellectual. Likes candlelight, books, and chill playlists.

ðŸ”¥ The Bold & Adventurous (Leads the Group Chat)

Supreme â€“ The leader. Balanced, experienced, always has opinions.

Mexican Pizza â€“ Spicy, energetic, party starter. Probably DJâ€™ed a house party.

BBQ Chicken â€“ Cool and confident with just a bit of a wild streak.

KBBQ Bulgogi + Sweet Potato Crust â€“ Trendsetter. Eats fusion before itâ€™s cool.

Anchovy Pizza â€“ Hot take personified. Either a genius or a menace.

ðŸ¦– The Maximalists (Chaos Gremlins, in a good way)
Loud, unpredictable, and often too much â€” and thatâ€™s the point.

Meat Loverâ€™s â€“ Gym bro energy. Possibly owns an air fryer and uses it aggressively.

Mac & Cheese Pizza â€“ Comfort gremlin. Brings a blanket everywhere.

A little offbeat, very passionate, probably has a hyper-specific hobby.

Veggie Loverâ€™s â€“ Eco-conscious. Probably knows their zodiac and your rising sign.

Pesto â€“ Quirky and underrated. Likes rainy days and funky socks.

Ricotta Garlic â€“ Sensual introvert. Talks slow, thinks deep, cooks good pasta.
